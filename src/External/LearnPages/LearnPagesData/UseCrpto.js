You can use it to buy things online, and you can send it instantly to other users anywhere in the world, at very low cost, needing nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection.Cryptocurrency can be cheaper and more convenient than many existing services like Paypal or Transferwise, if - for example - you regularly send money overseas.
